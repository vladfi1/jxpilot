General information about JXPilot

-found source of some bugs: the reliable data packets are followed by reliable data,
	which may not constitute complete packets
	currently these packets are just eaten up within the input loop, which causes errors
	what xpilot does is copy the data into a seperate buffer (cbuf) and then treats that seperately
